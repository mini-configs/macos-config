### MacOs instal Vagrant & VirtualBox
How install Vagrant and Virtual box using brew. 

Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.

**1) Update Brew**
``` console
$ brew update              
Updated 2 taps (homebrew/core and homebrew/cask).
==> Updated Formulae
broot               newman              serverless          syncthing
==> Updated Casks
keyshot             pdfelement          pycharm             pycharm-ce
```

**2) Install vagrant**
``` console
$ brew cask install vagrant   
==> Downloading https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.2.7/vagrant_2.2.7_x86_6

```

**4) Searches all known Casks for a partial or exact match**
`$ brew search virtualbox`

**5) Displays information about the given Cask**
` $ brew cask info virtualbox`

**6) Install the given cask - virtualbox**
`$ brew cask install virtualbox`

  _6.1_) If return an error like the one below. This is a macOS issue because of secure kext loading in High Sierra.
```console
Error: Failure while executing; 
...

Here's the output:
installer: Package name is Oracle VM VirtualBox
```

  _6.2_) So, try this and will work: 
```console
$ brew cask reinstall --force virtualbox --verbose --debug
```

  _6.3_) If you encounter another error like this `Error: Kernel.exit` during execution, go to Settings & Privacy in your configs in Mac, and allow Oracle Extension. And repeat step #6.2 see [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2459/_index.html), otherwise just pass.
  
**7)** Remove any older versions from the cellar
`$ brew cleanup`

**8)** Now add the Vagrant box you want to use. See more infos about Boxes [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/boxes.html) 
I used Windows 10 with visual studio 2015 (see box [here](senglin/win-10-enterprise-vs2015community)), you can use some version of Ubuntu ([hashicorp/precise64](https://app.vagrantup.com/hashicorp/boxes/precise64))or any other, following the same path.

```console
$ vagrant box add senglin/win-10-enterprise-vs2015community
```

You can find more boxes at Vagrant Cloud. 
Now create a test directory and cd into the test directory. Then we'll initialize the vagrant machine.

```
$ vagrant init win-10-enterprise-vs2015community
```
### Up And SSH
It is time to boot your first Vagrant environment. Now lets start the machine using the following command from your terminal:

```console
$ vagrant up
```

You can ssh into the machine now.

```console
$ vagrant ssh
```

Halt the vagrant machine now.
```console
$ vagrant halt
```
